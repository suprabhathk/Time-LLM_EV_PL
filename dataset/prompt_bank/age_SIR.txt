This is synthetic epidemic time series data from an age-heterogeneous SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model simulating disease transmission across two distinct population groups: Children (ages 0-18, N_C = 1,500,000) and Adults (ages 19+, N_A = 3,500,000). The model captures differential mixing patterns through a contact matrix structure (Equation 3.17), reflecting the fact that individuals within each age group contact each other at different rates.

  Mathematical Framework: The model implements a system of coupled ordinary differential equations where the force of infection for each age group i is calculated as λ_i = Σ_j(M_ij × I_j / N_j), representing the weighted sum of contacts across all groups. Here M_ij denotes the average number of contacts that an individual in group i has with members of group j per day. The contact matrix used is M = [[18, 9], [3, 12]], meaning children have 18 contacts with other children and 9 with adults daily, while adults have 3 contacts with children and 12 with other adults.

  Model Dynamics: The transmission dynamics follow three coupled differential equations per age group. For susceptible individuals: dS_i/dt = -β × S_i × λ_i, where β = 0.033 is the transmission rate per contact. For infected individuals: dI_i/dt = β × S_i × λ_i - γ × I_i, capturing both new infections from susceptible-infected contacts and recovery. For recovered individuals: dR_i/dt = γ × I_i, where γ = 1/3 day⁻¹ corresponds to an infectious period of 3 days. Population is strictly conserved: S_i + I_i + R_i = N_i for each age group at all times.

  Data Characteristics: The output contains daily measurements over 150 days with columns IA, IC (infected counts to be predicted), followed by SA, RA, SC, RC (susceptible and recovered for context). The epidemic typically exhibits different peak infection times and magnitudes between age groups due to the heterogeneous contact structure. Children generally show earlier and higher infection peaks due to their elevated within-group contact rates (18 vs 12 for adults). The model starts with minimal initial infections (1 infected individual per group) and evolves deterministically according to the ODE system, producing smooth epidemic curves characteristic of compartmental models.
