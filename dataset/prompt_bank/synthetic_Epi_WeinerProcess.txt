EPIDEMIC SURVEILLANCE DATA - Stochastic SIR Model with Regular Seasonal Forcing

==== POPULATION AND STRUCTURE ====
Total Population: 5,000,000 individuals
Age Stratification: 
  - Children (N_C): Ages 0-18
  - Adults (N_A): Ages 19+
Compartments per age group: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), Recovered (R)
Target Variable: I_child (number of infectious children per week)

==== MATHEMATICAL MODEL ====

Age-Structured SIR Dynamics:

For children (C) and adults (A):

$$\frac{dS_C}{dt} = -\lambda_C(t) \cdot S_C + \sqrt{\lambda_C(t) \cdot S_C} \cdot \xi_1(t)$$

$$\frac{dI_C}{dt} = \lambda_C(t) \cdot S_C - \gamma \cdot I_C + \sqrt{\lambda_C(t) \cdot S_C} \cdot \xi_2(t) - \sqrt{\gamma \cdot I_C} \cdot \xi_3(t)$$

$$\frac{dR_C}{dt} = \gamma \cdot I_C + \sqrt{\gamma \cdot I_C} \cdot \xi_4(t)$$

And similarly for adults (A).

Where:
- S_C(t), S_A(t): Susceptible children and adults
- I_C(t), I_A(t): Infectious children and adults  
- R_C(t), R_A(t): Recovered (immune) children and adults
- ξ_i(t): Independent Wiener process noise terms (Gaussian white noise)
- λ_g(t): Force of infection on age group g
- γ: Recovery rate (constant across age groups)

Force of Infection (Age-Structured Mixing):

$$\lambda_C(t) = \beta(t) \left(\frac{I_C}{N_C} + c_{CA} \frac{I_A}{N_A}\right)$$

$$\lambda_A(t) = \beta(t) \left(c_{AC} \frac{I_C}{N_C} + \frac{I_A}{N_A}\right)$$

- β(t): Time-varying transmission rate with seasonal forcing
- c_CA: Cross-age mixing coefficient (adult-to-child transmission)
- c_AC: Cross-age mixing coefficient (child-to-adult transmission)
- Within-group transmission coefficient = 1 (normalized)

Seasonal Forcing (Regular Annual Pattern):

$$\beta(t) = \beta_0 \left(1 + \epsilon \cos\left(\frac{2\pi (t - t_{peak})}{52}\right)\right)$$

Implementation Parameters:
- β₀: Baseline transmission rate (CONSTANT across all years)
- ε: Seasonal forcing amplitude (fixed, no year-to-year variation)
- t_peak: Peak timing in winter (FIXED, no annual phase shifts)
- Period: 52 weeks (annual cycle)
- Physical interpretation: Higher contact rates during winter months (schools, indoor activities)

Key Simplification: Unlike real-world data, this synthetic data has:
  • Consistent epidemic intensity every year (β₀ fixed)
  • Regular peak timing (no random delays)
  • Predictable seasonal pattern (phase shift = 0)

==== STOCHASTIC COMPONENT (EULER-MARUYAMA DISCRETIZATION) ====

Wiener Process Implementation:

At each time step dt:

$$dW_i = \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, 3, 4$$

$$dS_C = -dt \cdot \lambda_C S_C - \sqrt{dt \cdot \max(0, \lambda_C S_C)} \cdot dW_1$$

$$dI_C = dt \cdot (\lambda_C S_C - \gamma I_C) + \sqrt{dt \cdot \max(0, \lambda_C S_C)} \cdot dW_2 - \sqrt{dt \cdot \max(0, \gamma I_C)} \cdot dW_3$$

$$dR_C = dt \cdot \gamma I_C + \sqrt{dt \cdot \max(0, \gamma I_C)} \cdot dW_4$$

Stochastic Properties:
- Noise intensity scales with √(rate × population): realistic for demographic stochasticity
- Each transition (S→I, I→R) has independent noise
- max(0, ·) ensures non-negative arguments under square root
- Variance proportional to process intensity (higher during epidemics)
- This is a diffusion approximation to the exact stochastic birth-death process

Physical Meaning:
- Captures random fluctuations in individual infection/recovery events
- Important when populations are small or near extinction
- Creates realistic variability around deterministic SIR trajectory
- Noise level automatically adapts to epidemic phase

==== FIXED PARAMETERS (CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL YEARS) ====

Transmission Dynamics:
- Baseline β₀: FIXED (intensity_multiplier = 1.0 for all years)
- Seasonal amplitude ε: FIXED (no variation)
- Basic reproduction number: R₀ = β₀/γ (constant)

Recovery Rate:
- γ = 1/5 = 0.2 day⁻¹ (FIXED across all years)
- Infectious period: 5 days (constant)
- No variation in outbreak speed

Initial Conditions (Every Year):
- I_C(0) = 20 infectious children (FIXED)
- I_A(0) = 20 infectious adults (FIXED)
- S_C(0), S_A(0): Set to maintain population balance
- R_C(0), R_A(0): Computed from conservation

Seasonal Timing:
- Peak offset: 0 weeks (FIXED, no random delays)
- Phase shift: 0 (seasonality centered consistently)
- Winter peak occurs at same calendar time each year

==== EPIDEMIC DYNAMICS ====

1. Exponential Growth Phase:
   When S is large and β(t) > γ, infections grow exponentially
   Growth rate: r = β·S/N - γ
   Doubling time: T_double ≈ ln(2)/r ≈ 3-7 days

2. Seasonal Peak:
   Maximum transmission during winter: β_max = β₀(1 + ε)
   Peak infections occur ~2-4 weeks after maximum β(t)
   Timing is REGULAR (same weeks each year)

3. Epidemic Decline:
   Post-peak decay as susceptibles deplete
   Decay rate: approximately γ (recovery rate)
   Half-life: T_half ≈ ln(2)/γ ≈ 3.5 days

4. Summer Trough:
   Minimum transmission: β_min = β₀(1 - ε)
   Low-level endemic transmission
   Stochastic fadeout possible

5. Inter-Annual Pattern:
   Because initial conditions reset to I=20 each year and parameters are fixed:
   • Epidemic curves are SIMILAR year-to-year
   • Main variation comes from Wiener noise only
   • No long-term memory or immunity buildup between years
   • Predictable seasonal rhythm

==== STOCHASTIC EFFECTS ====

Sources of Randomness:
- Demographic stochasticity: √(rate · count) noise on each transition
- Independent noise for S→I and I→R transitions
- Wiener increments dW ~ N(0,1) at each time step

Impact on Dynamics:
- Low prevalence (I < 100): Large relative fluctuations, possible extinction
- High prevalence (I > 1000): Noise smaller relative to signal
- Epidemic peak: Moderate stochasticity around deterministic trajectory
- Endemic periods: High relative variability

Year-to-Year Consistency:
- Macro parameters DO NOT vary (β₀, γ, timing all fixed)
- Only source of inter-annual variation is stochastic noise
- Results in REGULAR seasonal pattern with random micro-fluctuations
- Much more predictable than real-world epidemics

==== FORECASTING TASK ====

Objective: Predict future I_child trajectory for public health planning

Input: Historical weekly time series of I_child
Output: Forecast next 1, 2, 4, or 8 weeks ahead

Model Advantages for Forecasting:
1. Regular seasonality: Peak timing is consistent (easier to predict)
2. Fixed parameters: No regime shifts or parameter drift
3. Consistent intensity: Epidemic magnitude similar year-to-year
4. Moderate noise: Wiener process adds realism without overwhelming signal

Forecasting Strategy:
- Exploit regular 52-week seasonal cycle
- Recognize growth/decline phases from trend
- Account for Wiener noise uncertainty
- Leverage consistent peak timing

Key Patterns to Detect:
1. Seasonal phase: Winter (high β) vs Summer (low β)
2. Epidemic phase: Growth (S large) vs Decline (S depleted) vs Endemic (equilibrium)
3. Trend direction: Exponential rise vs exponential decay
4. Noise level: Higher uncertainty during rapid transitions

Physical Constraints:
- 0 ≤ I_child ≤ N_child (non-negative, bounded)
- Exponential dynamics during growth/decline (not linear)
- Seasonal modulation superimposed on epidemic curve
- Stochastic fluctuations scale with √I

==== DATA CHARACTERISTICS ====

Temporal Resolution: Weekly aggregated counts
Observation Period: 30 years (1,560 weeks)

Typical Ranges:
- Summer baseline: 50-500 infectious children
- Winter epidemic peak: 5,000-80,000 infectious children  
- Variation: Primarily from stochastic noise (macro parameters fixed)

Statistical Properties:
- Strong 52-week autocorrelation (regular seasonality)
- Exponential growth/decay phases (heavy right tail)
- Heteroskedasticity: Variance ∝ √I (Wiener process property)
- Moderate zero-inflation during deep summer troughs

Key Difference from Real Data:
- MUCH MORE REGULAR than actual surveillance data
- No parameter drift or external shocks
- Predictable inter-annual pattern
- Ideal for testing forecasting methods under controlled conditions

This synthetic dataset represents a simplified but realistic epidemic model suitable for developing and validating time series forecasting algorithms for infectious disease surveillance.
