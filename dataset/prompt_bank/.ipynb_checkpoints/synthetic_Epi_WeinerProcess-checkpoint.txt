METHODOLOGY: 30-YEAR EPIDEMIC DATASET GENERATION (1990-2019)
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This dataset contains 30 independent epidemic simulations representing yearly 
flu-like disease outbreaks from 1990 to 2019. Each epidemic is modeled as a 
complete year-long trajectory with maximum variability to create diverse patterns 
suitable for machine learning applications.

MODEL STRUCTURE
---------------
Base Model: Age-Heterogeneous Stochastic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered)
- Two age groups: Children (N=1,500,000) and Adults (N=3,500,000)
- Compartments per age group: S (Susceptible), I (Infected), R (Recovered)
- Stochastic dynamics: Euler-Maruyama method with time step dt=0.1 days

Contact Matrix (average contacts per day):
                Children    Adults
    Children        18         9
    Adults           3        12

TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS
--------------------
Force of Infection:
    λᵢ(t) = β(t) × Σⱼ Mᵢⱼ × Iⱼ(t)/Nⱼ

where:
- β(t) = time-varying transmission rate (see Variability section)
- Mᵢⱼ = contact matrix element
- Iⱼ(t)/Nⱼ = fraction infected in age group j

Differential Equations (Stochastic):
    dSᵢ = -λᵢSᵢdt - √(λᵢSᵢdt)·dWₛᵢ
    dIᵢ = λᵢSᵢdt + √(λᵢSᵢdt)·dWₛᵢ - γᵢIᵢdt - √(γᵢIᵢdt)·dWᵢᵣ
    dRᵢ = γᵢIᵢdt + √(γᵢIᵢdt)·dWᵢᵣ

where dW represents Wiener processes (Gaussian white noise)

PARAMETER VARIABILITY (KEY INNOVATION)
---------------------------------------
To create diverse epidemic patterns, five sources of variability were introduced:

1. TRANSMISSION RATE β(t):
   Base: β₀ = 0.022 per day
   Year-specific multiplier: Uniform[0.6, 1.4]
   Seasonal forcing: β(t) = β₀ × βₘᵤₗₜ × (1 + 0.3·cos(2π(t-φ)/365))
   Result: Effective β ranges from ~0.009 to ~0.040

2. RECOVERY RATE γ:
   Variable infectious period: Uniform[3, 10] days
   Corresponding γ: Uniform[1/10, 1/3] per day
   Result: Some epidemics are fast (3-day infections), others slow (10-day)

3. START DATES:
   Offset from January 1: Uniform[-60, +60] days
   Result: Epidemics begin anytime between early November and early March

4. INITIAL CONDITIONS:
   Infected children I_C(0): Uniform[1, 50]
   Infected adults I_A(0): Uniform[1, 50]
   Result: Variable seeding intensity

5. SEASONAL PHASE SHIFT φ:
   Phase variation: Uniform[-45, +45] days
   Result: Peak transmission timing varies (some years early winter, others late)

EPIDEMIC CLASSIFICATION
------------------------
Based on parameter combinations, epidemics fall into three categories:

FAST: β_mult > 1.2 AND infectious period < 6 days
      → Peak around day 20-50, sharp rise and fall

MODERATE: 0.8 ≤ β_mult ≤ 1.2 OR 6 ≤ infectious period ≤ 7 days
          → Peak around day 60-100, moderate dynamics

SLOW: β_mult < 0.8 OR infectious period > 7 days
      → Peak around day 100-200+, gradual prolonged curve

SIMULATION DETAILS
------------------
Time span per epidemic: 365 days (full year)
Temporal resolution: dt = 0.1 days for numerical integration
Data sampling: Weekly (every 7 days)
Output per epidemic: ~52 weekly observations
Total dataset: ~1,560 observations (30 years × 52 weeks)

Numerical method: Euler-Maruyama (stochastic differential equations)
Programming: Python 3.x with NumPy for numerical computation

DATASET STRUCTURE
-----------------
Each row represents one week of data with the following variables:

TEMPORAL:
- calendar_year: 1990-2019
- date: Actual calendar date
- day_of_epidemic: Day within epidemic (0-364)
- week_of_epidemic: Week within epidemic (1-52)

STATE VARIABLES (population counts):
- S_child, I_child, R_child: Children compartments
- S_adult, I_adult, R_adult: Adult compartments
- total_infected: I_child + I_adult
- total_susceptible: S_child + S_adult
- total_recovered: R_child + R_adult

PARAMETERS (year-specific):
- beta: Current transmission rate
- beta_multiplier: Year's β multiplier (0.6-1.4)
- gamma: Recovery rate
- infectious_period_days: Days infectious (3-10)
- start_date_offset: Days from Jan 1 (-60 to +60)
- initial_I_C, initial_I_A: Initial infections
- phase_shift: Seasonal timing shift (-45 to +45 days)

KEY ASSUMPTIONS & LIMITATIONS
------------------------------
✓ Homogeneous mixing within age groups
✓ No births, deaths, or migration (closed population)
✓ No waning immunity (R stays recovered within each year)
✓ Independent epidemics (no carryover between years)
✓ No interventions (vaccination, social distancing, etc.)
✗ Does not model spatial heterogeneity
✗ No age-specific mortality or hospitalization
✗ No pathogen evolution or strain diversity

VALIDATION & QUALITY CHECKS
----------------------------
Peak timing range: 20-200+ days (successfully diverse)
Peak intensity range: ~40,000-800,000 total infected
Epidemic classification distribution:
  - FAST: ~30-35% of years
  - MODERATE: ~35-45% of years  
  - SLOW: ~25-35% of years

Conservation check: S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N for all t ✓
Non-negativity: All compartments ≥ 0 for all t ✓

INTENDED APPLICATIONS
---------------------
✓ Training ML models for epidemic forecasting
✓ Time series analysis and pattern recognition
✓ Testing anomaly detection algorithms
✓ Benchmarking prediction methods
✓ Educational demonstrations of epidemic variability
✓ Parameter sensitivity analysis
